Description:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array 
of characters s. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with 
O(1) extra memory.

Examples:
  Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
  Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

  Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
  Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Constraints:
  - 1 <= s.length <= 10^5

PROBLEM 47: Fizz Buzz
Difficulty: easy
Category: Math
Tags: Math, String, Simulation

Description:
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where: 
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5, answer[i] == "Fizz" if 
i is divisible by 3, answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5, and 
answer[i] == i (as a string) otherwise.

Examples:
  Input: n = 3
  Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

  Input: n = 5
  Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

  Input: n = 15
  Output: [...,"14","FizzBuzz"]

Constraints:
  - 1 <= n <= 10^4

PROBLEM 48: Majority Element
Difficulty: easy
Category: Arrays
Tags: Array, Hash Table, Sorting

Description:
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority 
element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.

Examples:
  Input: nums = [3,2,3]
  Output: 3

  Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
  Output: 2

Constraints:
  - n == nums.length
  - 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4

PROBLEM 49: Contains Duplicate
Difficulty: easy
Category: Arrays
Tags: Array, Hash Table

Description:
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice 
in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Examples:
  Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
  Output: true

  Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
  Output: false

  Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
  Output: true

Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

PROBLEM 50: Pascal's Triangle
Difficulty: easy
Category: Arrays
Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming

Description:
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. In 
Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Examples:
  Input: numRows = 5
  Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]

  Input: numRows = 1
  Output: [[1]]

Constraints:
  - 1 <= numRows <= 30
